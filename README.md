Aim: Create an effective price prediction model, validate the model’s prediction accuracy, identify the important home price
attributes which feed the model’s predictive power.

Methodology: Techniques involved feature engineering, feature selection, scaling, cleaning and handling of outliers. Dimensionality Reduction techniques were used to find the best suited features for the model. The algorithm – XGBRegressor was used for the prediction. It resulted in an accuracy of around 83%.
